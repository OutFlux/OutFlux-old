> OutFlux is a peer to peer based music streaming client/player similar to Popcorn Time, but for music, created with Electron. Don't be suprised if the project dies.

## To Do
### Currently Implementing
- Core Functionality

### Planned

- Add Music Player
- Design UI

### Considerations
- Equaliser for Player

**(Stage: Experimental)**

## Git Semantics
I am trying to use [Vincent Driessen's](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. Tell me because I stuff up (im new to this stuff).


## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Popcorn Time will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backward compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backward compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
